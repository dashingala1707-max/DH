1. Explain in your own words what a program is and how it functions.
A program is a set of instructions written in a programming language that tells a computer what to do. It functions by taking input, processing it according to the instructions, and producing an output.

2. What are the key steps involved in the programming process?
Problem analysis – Understand the problem.
Algorithm design – Plan the solution step by step.
Coding – Write the program in a programming language.
Compilation/Execution – Convert code to machine-readable form and run it.
Testing & Debugging – Find and fix errors.
Maintenance – Update the program as needed.

3. What are the main differences between high-level and low-level programming languages?
high-leval :this is the programming lenguage which is easyly understend by the human being.
low-leval:this is the programming language which is not understend by any human and the computer can easyly understend it.

4. Describe the roles of the client and server in web communication.
Client: Sends requests to access resources or services..
Server: Receives requests, processes them, and sends back responses.

5. Explain the function of the TCP/IP model and its layers.
The TCP/IP model allows computers to communicate over the internet. Its layers:
Application Layer – Handles network services like HTTP, FTP.
Transport Layer – Provides data transfer (TCP/UDP).
Internet Layer – Routes data packets (IP).
Network Access Layer – Handles physical transmission of data.

6. Explain Client Server Communication.
Client-server communication is a request-response model:
The client requests data or service.

The server processes the request and sends back a response.
This allows multiple clients to access centralized resources efficiently.

7. How does broadband differ from fiber-optic internet?
Broadband: General term for high-speed internet over cable, DSL, or wireless; slower than fiber.
Fiber-optic: Uses light signals through fiber cables; faster, more stable, and supports higher bandwidth.

8. What are the differences between HTTP and HTTPS protocols?
HTTP:this protocol is used when any website is not safe for ypu and your data.
HTTPS:this protocols is used when any website is fully secure with you and your data.

9. What is the role of encryption in securing applications?
Encryption converts data into a coded format that only authorized users can read. It protects sensitive information from hackers, ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and security of applications.
